            The Chennai Astronomy Club was started in November 2013 by a group of like minded individuals committed to the cause of promoting astronomy in Chennai. Our activities include star parties where astronomers head to dark locations outside the city limits to observe the skies with their equipment. We also conduct regular meetings, hangouts and outreach programs for schools, organisations and the less priviledged.

            <blockquote>
              I think music is about our internal life. It's part of the way people touch each other. That's very precious to me. And astronomy is, in a sense, the very opposite thing. Instead of looking inwards, you are looking out, to things beyond our grasp. <strong>Brian May</strong>
