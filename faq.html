      I am new to astronomy. Where can I buy telescopes? (and/or) <br>
      Which telescope to buy?
    </h4>
  </header>

  <div class="post-description">
    If you are just getting started, <strong>DO NOT BUY A TELESCOPE</strong>.<br>
    Get started with naked eye observations or binoculars and learn the basics of
    astronomy and visual observations first. Get a telescope only after 2 years of
    doing this. By then, you would have already figured out which telescope to buy.
