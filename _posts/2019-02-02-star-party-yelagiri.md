Chennai astronomy club’s first-star party of 2019 was held on Saturday night (February 2, 3) in YMCA grounds, Yelagiri. Worthy of a year’s opening star party, the sky was brilliant with an amazing level of transparency.

<h2> 
A First-person report 
</h2>

<p>
Yelagiri, a 3-hour drive from Chennai is one of the few legitimate dark sky places in the state with a Bortle scale number of around 4. We stayed at the relatively affordable YMCA Camping grounds. A makeshift observation area was set up on the rooftop of the two-story hotel. 
<br>
The telescopes were set up late in the evening, with the session slated to begin at 7. Our primary equipment was an 8-inch Dobsonian reflector. Other equipment being a 130mm equatorial and a couple of 10x50 Porro binoculars. Before the session, Siva gave everyone a brief lecture on the basics of optical astronomy and a few inner tips and tricks.
<br>
The sky, though not very pleasing initially turned out to be palatable towards the later part of the night and early in the morning. 
<br>
A brief list of the objects that were spotted:

•    M42, Orion Nebula (with the pinkish hue that was visible to a naked eye).

The planets viz, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Venus were a visual treat in the morning sky, seen around the brilliant backdrop of a surrounding hill. 
<br>
To wrap things up, we could not have hoped for a better start to the year. It was truly one of the best star parties we have ever had.
<br>
We hope to write about the next event very soon.
<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
Clear skies!<br>
